Fine-scale rugosity was quantified using the chain-and-tape method (Risk, 1972) with a small link chain (5 mm). Three replicate rugosity measurements were made along each transect (averaged per transect), with each measurement covering 5 m linear distance. Herbivorous fish biomass was quantified at all sites using underwater visual censuses (UVC) carried out along eight 30 Ã— 5 m belt transects by a single surveyor (Dickens et al., 2011).

Biomass values were obtained using the midpoint of the size class from established lengthweight relationships (Kulbicki et al., 2005;Green and Bellwood, 2009).

For the following 30 min, all nominally herbivorous fish detected within the frame were recorded to species level in order to assess taxonomic richness from video recordings.

This advice emphasises the importance of combining community insights with scientific methods to achieve effective fisheries management, specifically targeting the protection of fish spawning aggregations (FSAs). The synergistic use of traditional and scientific knowledge, rigorous data collection, careful analysis and validation, along with community engagement and consensus building, are key to the successful implementation and enforcement of conservation measures, such as the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). Challenges such as enforcement and funding for monitoring should be acknowledged and addressed early on in the planning of future CBFM initiatives.];  [Fisheries managers and conservation practitioners are increasingly recognising that FSAs need protection, with marine protected areas (MPAs) and closed seasons being the most commonly implemented conservation measures... In Roviana Lagoon the monitoring program served as an effective vehicle for building community support for managing the FSA, and it also provided an independent validation of local knowledge on grouper spawning seasons. Results of the monitoring study showed that while local knowledge can be highly detailed, like all knowledge systems, it is not infallible, with science-based underwater monitoring building a more complete picture of FSA seasons than local knowledge alone. Clearly, local knowledge is most useful in management and conservation if it is carefully collected, evaluated and validated, and the cultural sensitivities and confidentiality of local knowledge is respected... In this study it was local knowledge and the scientific results of the community-based monitoring program that led to the development of appropriate management measures for this FSA, with the aggregation declared a year-round community-based MPA in 2006...];  [Local knowledge should be independently validated before it is used as the basis for management or conservation. P. areolatus is extremely vulnerable to nighttime spearfishing, due to long residency times at FSAs, high densities in shallow water, and the ease with which it can be approached at night. Clearly FSAs of P. areolatus need to be protected from nighttime spearfishing wherever it is practiced. In Roviana Lagoon, the monitoring program served as an effective vehicle for building community support for managing the FSA, and it also provided an independent validation of local knowledge on grouper spawning seasons. It was the combination of local knowledge and the scientific results of the community-based monitoring program that led to the development of appropriate management measures for this FSA, with the aggregation declared a year-round community-based MPA in 2006.]","No Data","Data"

Indeed, our survey data could provide the comprehensive baseline data needed to look at causal relationships for those villages that establish a LMMA in the future. An important relationship for future consideration is that between the presence of a protected area and health outcomes of villagers. Although touched upon here through the correlation between probability of consuming different sources of food and presence of a protected area, we again cannot establish any causal effects. In addition, our survey ques- tions were not detailed enough relative to diet and health for us to say anything meaningful about this relationship. In any case, future work that extends on our questions around diet and health could, in conjunction with our current data, allow for a better exploration of this topic. The use of MPAs, and more specifically LMMAs, is likely to increase given the greater recognition of marine resource degradation, the need for greater marine conservation, and the perceived and demonstrated benefits of the LMMA model. Often the burden of such marine conser - vation falls on developing communities, the villages of Kadavu being a prime example. It is therefore important to determine whether these marine conservation tools impose undue harm, confer lasting benefits, or land somewhere in the middle. The findings presented here should help to answer this question.;  

""In terms of future research, the establishment of baseline data will allow for causal implications of LMMAs to be discovered. In terms of policy design, understanding the current state of affairs in Kadavu is beneficial for maintaining and extending its own LMMA network.

of the society. The community would typically display homogeneity in
terms of kinship, culture, and often fishing practices. The sense of belonging
and community, by whatever yardstick measured, would be strong [25].
The traditional institutions were apparently capable of planning, develop-
ing, and managing the coastal fisheries at least with respect to the mainten-
ance of the local economy [4 —7]. Resources were harvested according to
a strategy which would take into account: the level of exploitation the
resource might tolerate; observance of conservation regulations; and ad-
herence to local access arrangements. Indeed there is justification in
regarding these systems as having achieved, at least until recent times, the
elusive goal of sustainability [10, 12].""

This community-based management system in the Solomon Islands declined with the emergence of centralized management controls that replaced traditional institutions with government bureaucracy and legislative frameworks catering to national economic objectives, thus diminishing the previously strong community-based management and leading to a centralized fisheries management regime.

""To optimise the development opportunities the Solomon Islands Gov- ernment sought to replace the traditional institutions and the supporting
customary law with a new district and national governmental apparatus.
The traditional social hierarchies already weakened were diminished fur-
ther in power and importance as the new political structure was adopted.
The impact of commercial activity became more widespread and custom-
ary law was marginalised by an exogenous legal system. The self-contained
management structures of the traditional institutions were replaced by a centralized bureaucracy.""; In terms of the origins of the people of the coastal settlements, it is believed that the Solomon Islands have been inhabited since 2000 BC when settled by Melanesians [13]. In subsequent centuries the outlying islands of the north and east were colonised by Polynesians and more recently there has been immigration of Micronesian people from Kiribati and Tuvalu. There were also many other visitors and colonists to the islands, the frequency of contact increased after the advent of the first European explorers, the Spanish led by Alvaro de Mendana in 1567. The effects of the more recent European influences are discussed in more detail later in the paper.
For the Pacific Islanders the sea has served a variety of practical and cultural functions [14, 15]. The ‘saltwater peoples’ of the Solomons have always looked to the coastal waters as a source of food. There was thus the imperative, in what was essentially a needs-based economy, to husband the marine biological resources [12] and the coastal communities have for centuries presided over well-organised fisheries. It is believed that this was due, in no small measure, to the existence of a custom that conferred tenure of the land and sea to the local fishermen [16]. Furthermore, the communal ownership of the rights of access to the fisheries was enhanced by being packaged in a context where the definition of sea territories appears to have prompted a positive expression of collective action [17, 18]. Thereby the local people were able to successfully moderate fisheries management problems that have induced crisis elsewhere in the world [19, 20]. [...]

The development and maintenance of CBM is not a linear or ultimately static process but exists in equilibrium with forces that tend to move the fisheries management function to a central location. This equilibrium shifts between community-based and centralised fisheries management regimes. The characteristics of the CBM system of the Solomon islands are reviewed and the reasons for its decline from the mid to late 1900s when it was marginalised by forces that have led to the establishment of a centralised management system are evaluated.

""Results of 115 interviews concluded that proximity to a fishing market, dependence on marine resources, food security, income and international commitments were significant variables influencing stakeholder's WTP and WtCT to manage a MPA. We argue that there is a discrepancy between WtCT and WTP driven by income constraints. Thus, by using WTP and WtCT to support financing of a MPA network, a Provincial Trust Fund (PTF) could promote an equitable and benefits-based contribution. Equally important, a PTF has a polycentric and decentralized governance model, which endorses sustainable management of traditional fishing communities. The conclusions provide insight into a bottom-up approach for long-term financial sustainability of Fiji's national MPA commitments.""","No Data","Data"
